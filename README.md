# Welcome to The Time Meowt.
[Time Meowt](https://github.com/rachelheyvaert/cat-attack-meow.git)

A web application to learn unique facts about cats and enjoy adorable images along the way.

## Getting  Started
This frontend application contains single HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Upon loading the page, you will see 4 buttons labeled "Meow, "0 Likes", "Adopt", and "Hiss". 

The button labeled "Meow", when clicked, will render an interesting fact along with an image (The images will be either a photo or gif). If "Meow" is pressed again, a new fact and image will appear as well as a reset like count. 

You may "like" the fact and image pair as many times as you want. Then if you clcik  "Adopt" it will save the pair plus the like count to the bottom of the page. You may save as many as you wish. 

If you want to clear the page, press the "Hiss" button to begin again. 

Have fun!
