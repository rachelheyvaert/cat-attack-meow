# Welcome to The Cat Fact App.

A web application to learn unique facts about cats and enjoy adorable images along the way.

## Getting  Started
This frontend application contains single HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Upon loadiing the page, you will see 3 buttons labeled "Meow, "Hiss", and "Cat Person". The one labeled "Meow", when clicked, will render an interesting fact along with an image. (The images will be either photos or gifs.) If "Meow" is pressed again, a new fact will appear below the previous one and a new image will appear. If you would like to clear your facts, press the "hiss" button.

The "Cat person" button when pressed will count you in as a cat person and will change your cursor to a special character.
