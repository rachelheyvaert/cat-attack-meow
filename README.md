[Cat Fact](https://github.com/rachelheyvaert/cat-attack-meow.git)

A web application to learn unique facts about cats and enjoy adorable images along the way.

## Getting  Started
This frontend application contains single HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Upon loadiing the page, you will see 3 buttons labeled "Meow, "Hiss", and "0 Likes". The button labeled "Meow", when clicked, will render an interesting fact along with an image. (The images will be either photos or gifs.) If "Meow" is pressed again, a new fact and image will appear. If you want to keep track of how many images and facts you enjoyed please press the like button each time. The "Hiss" button will clear the page and reset the like count.
